### Statement about the random numbers that were assigned
waveSpecificRandomNumberStatement <- "Participants received two random numbers, both between (and including) 1 and 4. The value of these numbers, in combination with information participants provided, determined for which behaviors the determinants were measured. Specifically, all participants answered questions about visiting a nightlife first aid site in two different situations: when one had a complaint oneself, and with a friend who had a complaint. In each of these situations, the complaint could be a light complaint, an alcohol-related complaint, or a substance-related complaint. Regarding which type of complaint the questions were formulated depended on participants' alcohol- and substance use as well as these random numbers.

Specifically, regarding visiting the first aid for themselves, participants who did not use alcohol or other substances always received questions about a light complaint. Participants who only used alcohol received questions about a light complaint if the first random number was 1, and about an alcohol-related complaint otherwise. Participants who only used other substances than alcohol received questions about light complaints if the first random number was 1, and about a substance-related complaint otherwise. Participants who used both alcohol and other substances received questions about light complaints if the first random number was 1, about alcohol-related complaints if the first random number was 2, and about substance-related complaints otherwise.

Regarding visiting the first aid with a friend, participants who did not use alcohol or other substances, or who only used alcohol, received questions where nothing about substance use was mentioned if the second random number was 1 or 2, and questions about a situation where the other (i.e. the friend) had used drugs otherwise. Participants who did use other substances received questions about a situation where nothing was mentioned about substance use if the second random number was 1, questions about a situation where the other had used substances if the second random number was 2, and questions about a situation where the participant had used substances themselves if the second random number was 3 of 4.";

### Specific thank-yous for people
waveSpecificThankYous <- "For this wave specifically, we would like to thank Ronald Litsenburg and Jan Krul for thinking along with the questionnaire.";
